    These doodles differ from[ WEEB_DOODLES ]
    in that all[ WEEB_DOODLES ]are done only 
    with[ 1X_SIZED_TILES ]because I have plans
    to extract the tile data and pack the designs
    into a more compact format in the future .

    Here are some ideas :

        WEEB_DOODLES : Could be used to procedurally generate
                     : auto tile artwork designs or decals .

        FRACTAL_DOODLES : Could be used to create animated
                        : visualizations to music as one
                        : levelpack[ draws_into ]another
                        : levelpack. (levelpack==hotel)
