    Hello Berry ,

        I found your original post entertaining .
        I will now give you serious answers to
        the following questions :

    Q_1. How would a function return early because of a missing semicolon ?
    Q_2. If the JS is unrecognizable as JS then semicolons are not the problem .

    A_1. I have inserted two example files to show you :

         AIM/DOC/RED/SEMI_COLONS/SEMI_INJECTION.HTM
         AIM/DOC/RED/SEMI_COLONS/FIXED.HTM

    A_2. Problems and solutions are relative to your goals.
         In the industry, we like to use the bus analogy a
         lot. So let's go with that.
         
         I get hit by a bus tomorrow and die.
         I wrote my code like an __INSANE__ person.
         
         My code base is now dead.
         
         I get hit by a bus tomorrow and die.
         I wrote my code exactly how __UNCLE_BOB__ told me to.
         
         My code base is now dead.
