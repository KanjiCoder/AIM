
    @M_N@ : Meeting_Notes , 2023_11_30 ( Nov11th , year 2023 AD , about 1 year into world war 3 )

    1st project & 2nd project , why do they work together?
    2nd project is the one with the potential.
    1st project is just us finishing a game .
    there are a million ninja platformers.
    Josh has designed these games with the idea that
    he will be the one to code these.

    Combinations of simple elements .

    NOte : Sea of theives has no competition after
         : existing for 5 years . And there are some
         : big problems with it that Josh had brought
         : up before .

    PVPVE Sandbox game . ( did I abbreviate that correctly )
    Put us on the same playing level with rare.
    Not sea of theives, it is a __BULLET_HELL__ .

    You are in a shared server with other players .
    You are collecting loot.
    You don't get credit until you turn the loot in .
    Loot is a NON_LIQUID_ASSET. Pun intended ?

    Bullet hell is doable.
    Space game ( like asteroids ) very easy to program.
    It's not a AAA title. Articles will be written .

    SCREWIN THE POOCH ( Sea of theives is screwing pooch ).
    They don't know what to do to continue support for this
    game . There is a window of opprotunity , a gap in the
    market .

    RARE is the abusive boyfriend and we are going
    to white night this shit and rescue some players
    from a horrible experience .

    Josh is confident that he could do this .
    But Josh hates code with the passion of 
    1,000 burning red dwarf suns .

    A problem with tutorialists :
    They will always try to make these
    "all in 1 games" a series that is like 
    40 videos , and it's not like you need
    everything in those 40 videos...

    And the last video the tutorial kind of 
    "peters out". They don't have a good
    sense of what a "complete game" is .


    The first game is dead simple.
    Cater's to Josh's skillsets .
    
    Hopefully a month or two of simple tasks on
    my end and then Josh can just work on level
    design.

    We need experience going through the entire
    process. What is it like to publish a game
    on steam ?

    Josh does not enjoy producing content .
    Josh waiting for AI to catch up .
    Josh wants to replace me with AI , bastard .

    This should be fun .

    Always some type of suffering.
    You must pick your flavor .
    #CenobiteEDU

    The tile system in the first game .

    NEXT STEPS :

        1. Wall Slide   : If you hit wall while airborn
                        : you will latch to it and slide.
                        : Doesn't require you to press
                        : arrow key against the wall.
                        
        2. Wall Jump    : From wall sliding we can press
                        : the jump button to jump away
                        : from the wall and upward.

DONE    3. Reset Button : "R" to reset .

        4. We need some type of obstacle that triggers
           a losing state.

        5. We need a pass through platform  .
           Like the ladders in atomic alice .
           ( like a cloud, or rooftop as Josh was )
           ( going over in ASprite                )

DONE    6. Start Screen . Basic title/intro .
           Don't worry about making it look nice .

DONE    7. DON'T code pause button - DONE .

    Josh :
        You are going to startup ... AH! Start screen .
        Very fast paced . No health . No lives .
        No save system. This is real fucking life .
        Flappy bird, everyone cloned it , and none of
        the clones went anywhere.
        BECAUSE : 1ST_TO_MARKET_BITCHES
        
        Josh is excited to design some levels.
        Described as a rail platformer.
        Back in my day when there were arcades .
        Starfox64 is quinton-essential branching system.
        Alternate paths within the level will bring
        you to a different level after you finish
        the current one.

        Branching level design. Good times.
        What happens if I take this other branch ?
        You can always merge branches back together
        to avoid proliferation. Temporary detours
        that all lead to the same end destination
        level at the end .

        Game : "Getting Over It"
        Game : "That Climbing Game That All The Streamers Were Playing... oh fuck my column limit nooooo"
        
        It catches on if it catches on .
        Once those game grumps answer our fucking
        calls we will be millionaires .

        I just want to make 5 dollars so I can go to 7-11
        and flash my money at the clerk . Then get TWO
        SLURPEES. DIABETES SIZE .

        We are making a PVPE sandbox game ....
        But can we prove that we can do anything
        in general ?

        All the good short names are taken.

        "Ninja and the quest for the Jade statue"

        All Josh has to do is change that asset and
        come out with another pack of levels and then
        you've got an expansion.

        Something to keep Josh busy.

        Can we get 12 players playing asteroids 
        together on a server ?

        Well... we could... but does HOW matter ?
        I mean, kidnap 12 people , make them play .

        Recommendation : Start out with 4 or 8 to figure
                       : out how the netcode will scale .

        How does the game work under :
            SUB_OPTIMAL_CONDITIONS

        If someone wants to cheat... well... probably
        let them because this is our first game and
        anti-cheat is going to make stuff hard as fuck.

        Only the latest mario cart has 12 player races.
        Mario Kart on switch had 8 ? 8 concurrent players .

        We might need to make sure we can make a game that
        brings in at least 5 dollars a month . Because 
        a simple dev server is... not free anymore from
        all of my research .

        Authorative server that syncs .

        Game maker may have some degree of web socket ability .

        ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    Existing solutions for collision detection in GameMaker?
    Some type of spatial partitioning .

    Saturday, Sunday, or Monday are the best days.
    Usually around 2PM ( washington the state )
        
    ********************************************************
    Lets do the 9TH . A bit extra , 
    but it's either that or a few days from now .
    ********************************************************

    Easy on us , hard to win though .
