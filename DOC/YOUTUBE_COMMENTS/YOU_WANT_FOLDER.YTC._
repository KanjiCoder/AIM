
    I want to keep my file paths short , 
    and "YOUTUBE_COMMENTS" / "YOU_TUBE_COMMENTS"
    is kind of a long string...

    But, it's obviously more easily readable than "YTC".

    So how do we get  "The best of both worlds" ?

    EASY :

        Folder "YOUTUBE_COMMENTS" , we keep it, but it
        only contains this file, and this file is
        telling you you need to :

    GO_TO[ AIM/DOC/YTC ]
                  @YTC@ : You_Tube_Comments
